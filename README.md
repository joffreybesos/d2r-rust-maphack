# d2r-rust-maphack

Since ladder season 3 is starting I thought I'd add a release a small maphack with basic features.

It's not going to be as feature complete as d2r-mapview but at least it's something.  
Since it's new it's not on blizzard's radar yet.

## How to run

Click on the releases on the right and download the latest executable.
Then launch D2R and then launch the executable afterwards.

Note: This DOES NOT NEED old d2lod. Instead it will reveal the normal automap you get in game. This is a standalone executable.

## Troubleshooting

If you find the map isn't showing, try uninstalling and reinstalling D2R.
Otherwise ask in the discord for help.
